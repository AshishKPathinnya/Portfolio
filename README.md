## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Design Pattern**: Single-page application with smooth scrolling navigation
- **Styling Approach**: Custom CSS with CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- **Typography**: Inter font family from Google Fonts
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.0.0 for iconography

### Static Server
- **Backend**: Simple Python HTTP server for local development
- **Purpose**: Serves static files with CORS headers enabled
- **Port**: Configured to run on port 5000

## Key Components

### 1. HTML Structure (index.html)
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Navigation bar with smooth scroll links
- Hero section with animated typing text
- Responsive meta viewport configuration
- External font and icon library integrations

### 2. Styling System (styles.css)
- Dark theme with background color `#0a0a0a`
- Modern glassmorphism effect on navigation (backdrop-filter blur)
- Responsive design principles
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Smooth transitions and animations

### 3. Interactive Features (script.js)
- Smooth scrolling navigation between sections
- Typing animation effect for hero text
- DOM manipulation for dynamic content display
- Event-driven interactions

### 4. Development Server (server.py)
- Custom HTTP request handler extending SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
- CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Static file serving from current directory

## Data Flow

### User Interaction Flow
1. **Page Load**: Static HTML loads with CSS and JavaScript
2. **Navigation**: Click events trigger smooth scrolling to sections
3. **Animations**: Typing animations execute on page load with delays
4. **Responsive Behavior**: CSS media queries adapt layout to screen size

### Content Delivery
- Static files served directly from filesystem
- No database or dynamic content generation
- Client-side rendering only

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family for typography
- **Font Awesome**: Version 6.0.0 for icons
- **Preconnect**: Optimized font loading with DNS prefetching

### No Database
- Pure static website with no persistent data storage
- No user authentication or session management
- No backend API endpoints

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- Python HTTP server for development environment
- CORS-enabled for local testing
- Hot-reload requires manual refresh

### Production Considerations
- Static hosting compatible (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
- No server-side requirements
- CDN-friendly for global distribution
- Minification recommended for production builds

### Performance Optimizations
- Preconnect directives for external fonts
- Smooth scroll behavior in CSS
- Efficient DOM querying in JavaScript
- Minimal external dependencies

## Technical Decisions

### Why Vanilla JavaScript?
- **Problem**: Need for simple interactions without complexity
- **Solution**: Vanilla JS for typing animations and smooth scrolling
- **Rationale**: Lightweight, no build process, fast loading
- **Trade-offs**: More verbose code but better performance

### Why Python HTTP Server?
- **Problem**: Need local development server for testing
- **Solution**: Python's built-in HTTP server with CORS support
- **Rationale**: Simple, no additional dependencies, cross-platform
- **Trade-offs**: Development-only, not suitable for production

### Why Dark Theme?
- **Problem**: Modern web developer portfolio needs contemporary design
- **Solution**: Dark background with contrasting text and glassmorphism
- **Rationale**: Professional appearance, reduced eye strain, modern aesthetic
- **Trade-offs**: May not appeal to all users, requires careful contrast management
